 \caption{The coronal hole segmentation problem.
 	The figure illustrates the manual segmentation process where
 	    the coronal holes appear as dar regions in
 	    the Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images.  
 	Black regions represent solar regions for which
 	    we do not have any observations.
