  \caption{Coronal hole matching results. 
  	 \textit{New} refers to coronal holes that appear in the physical model but are not seen
  	     in the consensus segmentation maps.
  	 \textit{Missing} refers to coronal holes that appear in the consensus maps
  	     but are not produced in the physical model.
  	 Note that by definition, a coronal hole cannot be both 
  	      new and missing.        
     The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of
     92.8\%.}
